udown, create spontaneous events with locals.

###Why I created udown
Getting back into tennis, I needed I began looking for people to play with. There are plenty of platforms like meetups and facebook groups designed to do just this, but neither are very fun and really don't encourage user commitment. What do I mean by this?

Both of these groups are designed around long term scheduling of events. You want to play tennis two weeks from next thursday Maybe... how do I know what I will be doing that far out, and honestly planning this far out turns what should be fun into a chore. I want to play now, u down?

###How does udown work?
simply signup, turn on location or enter a zip code and see all available players/locations nearby. Quickly arrange a match by selecting a location which then sends a notification to all active users. Once another user(s) accepts the invite, google maps starts navigation and a chat opens between the two or more users so they may communicate further. That's it, let the games begin!
